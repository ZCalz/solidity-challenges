# Stall Voting

An instance of this contract is deployed to handle a particular voting decison. Voters must contribute an amount of ETH prior to a set blockNumber before voting begins in order to calculate their weight in voting. Unfortunately there is an issue in its design that proves detrimental to the voters of this decison. There are bad actor wanting to halt voting by any means possible and cause as much harm to stakeholders participating in this vote. It is up to you to indentify the vulnerability and inform the voters so that a fix can be implemented prior to the urgent voting period!

Your Challenge:

- Hack this contract to prevent voters from voting and lose access of their funds.
- Test your exploit by running `forge test --mp test/exploits/weighted-voting/WeightedVoting.t.sol`
